# PRVHASH - Pseudo-Random-Value Hash #

## Introduction ##

PRVHASH is a hash function that generates a [uniform pseudo-random number
sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator)
derived from the message. PRVHASH is conceptually similar (in the sense of
using a pseudo-random number sequence as a hash) to [`keccak`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3)
and [`RadioGatun`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RadioGat%C3%BAn)
schemes, but is a completely different implementation of such concept.
PRVHASH is both a ["randomness extractor"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Randomness_extractor)
and an "extendable-output function" (XOF).

PRVHASH can generate 64- to unlimited-bit hashes, yielding hashes of roughly
equal quality independent of the chosen hash length. PRVHASH is based on
64-bit math. The use of the function beyond 1024-bit hashes is easily
possible, but has to be statistically tested. For example, any 32-bit element
extracted from 2048-, or 4096-bit resulting hash is as collision resistant as
just a 32-bit hash. It is a fixed execution time hash function that depends
only on message's length. A streamed hashing implementation is available.

PRVHASH is solely based on the butterfly effect, inspired by [LCG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator)
pseudo-random number generators. The generated hashes have good avalanche
properties. For best security, a random seed should be supplied to the hash
function, but this is not a requirement. In practice, the `InitVec` (instead
of `UseSeed`), and initial hash, can both be randomly seeded (see the
suggestions in `prvhash64.h`), adding useful initial entropy (`InitVec` plus
`Hash` total bits of entropy).

64-, 128-, 192-, 256-, 512- and 1024-bit PRVHASH hashes pass all
[SMHasher](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher) tests. Other hash lengths were
not thoroughly tested, but extrapolations can be made. The author makes no
cryptographic claims (neither positive nor negative) about PRVHASH-based
constructs.

PRVHASH core hash function can be used as a PRNG with an arbitrarily-chosen
(practically unlimited) period, depending on the number of hashwords in the
system.

Please see the `prvhash64.h` file for the details of the basic hash function
implementation (the `prvhash.h`, `prvhash4.h`, `prvhash42.h` are outdated
versions). Note that `64` refers to core hash function's variable size.
While this hash function is most likely irreversible, according to SAT
solver-based testing, it does not feature a preimage resistance. This function
should not be used in open systems, without a secret seed.

The default `prvhash64.h`-based 64-bit hash of the string `The cat is out of
the bag` is `eb405f05cfc4ae1c`.

A proposed short name for hashes created with `prvhash64.h` is `PRH64-N`,
where `N` is the hash length in bits (e.g. `PRH64-256`).

## Minimal PRNG for Everyday Use ##

The core hash function can be easily integrated into your applications, to be
used as an effective PRNG. The period of this minimal PRNG is at least
2<sup>160</sup>. The initial parameters can be varied at will, and won't
"break" the PRNG. Setting only the `Seed` value guarantees a random start
point within the whole PRNG period, with at least 2<sup>64</sup> spacing.
The code follows.

```
#include "prvhash_core.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	uint64_t Seed = 0;
	uint64_t lcg = 0;
	uint64_t Hash = 0;

	uint64_t v = 0;
	uint64_t i;

	for( i = 0; i < ( 1ULL << 28 ); i++ )
	{
		v = prvhash_core64( &Seed, &lcg, &Hash );
	}

	printf( "%llu\n", v );
}
```

Note that such minimal 1-hashword PRNG is most definitely not
cryptographically secure: its state can be solved by a SAT solver pretty fast;
this applies to other structuring ("parallel", "fused", multiple hashwords;
with daisy-chaining being harder to solve). The known way to make PRNG
considerably harder to solve for a SAT solver, with complexity corresponding
to system's size, is to combine two adjacent PRNG outputs via XOR operation;
this obviously has a speed impact, and produces output with more than 1
solution (most probably, 2). This, however, does not measurably increase the
probability of PRNG output overlap, which stays below
1/2<sup>sys_size_bits</sup>; in tests, practically undetectable.

So, the basic PRNG with some, currently not formally-proven, security is as
follows (XOR two adjacent outputs to produce a single "compressed" PRNG
output):

```
		v = prvhash_core64( &Seed, &lcg, &Hash );
		v ^= prvhash_core64( &Seed, &lcg, &Hash );
```

A similar approach is to simply skip the next generated random number, but it
is slightly less secure. It is likely that PRVHASH's k-equidistribution of
separate outputs is implicitly secure.

## TPDF Dithering ##

The core hash function can be used to implement a "statistically-good" and
"neutrally-sounding" dithering noise for audio signals; for both
floating-point to fixed-point, and bit-depth conversions.

	uint64_t rv = prvhash_core64( &Seed, &lcg, &Hash );
	double tpdf = ( (int64_t) (uint32_t) rv - (int64_t) ( rv >> 32 )) * 0x1p-32;

## Floating-Point PRNG ##

The following expression can be used to convert 64-bit unsigned value to
full-mantissa floating-point value, without a truncation bias:

	uint64_t rv = prvhash_core64( &Seed, &lcg, &Hash );
	double v = ( rv >> ( 64 - 53 )) * 0x1p-53;

## Entropy PRNG ##

PRVHASH can be also used as an efficient general-purpose PRNG with an external
entropy source injections (like how the `/dev/urandom` works on Unix): this
was tested, and works well when 8-bit true entropy injections are done
inbetween 8 to 2048 generated random bytes (delay is also obtained via the
entropy source). An example generator is implemented in the `prvrng.h` file:
simply call the `prvrng_test64p2()` function.

`prvrng_gen64p2()`-based generator passes [`PractRand`](http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/)
32 TB threshold with rare non-systematic "unusual" evaluations. Which suggests
it's the working randomness extractor that can "recycle" entropy of any
statistical quality, probably the first in the world.

Note that due to the structure of the core hash function the probability of
PRNG completely "stopping", or "stalling", or losing internal entropy, is
absent.

The core hash function, without external entropy injections, with any initial
combination of `lcg`, `Seed`, and `Hash` eventually converges into one of
random number sub-sequences. These are mostly time-delayed versions of only a
smaller set of unique sequences. There are structural limits in this PRNG
system which can be reached if there is only a small number of hashwords in
the system. PRNG will continously produce non-repeating random sequences given
external entropy input, but their statistical quality on a larger frames will
be limited by the size of `lcg` and `Seed` variables, and the number of
hashwords in the system, and the combinatorial capacity of the external
entropy. A way to increase the structural limit is to use a
"parallel" PRNG structure (arrangement) demonstrated in the `prvhash64s.h`
file, which additionally increases the security exponentially. Also any
non-constant entropy input usually increases the period of randomness, which,
when extrapolated to hashing, means that the period increases by message's
combinatorial capacity (or the number of various combinations of its bits).
The maximal PRNG period's 2<sup>N</sup> exponent is hard to approximate
exactly, but in most tests it was equal to at least system's size in bits,
minus the number of hashwords in the system, minus 1/4 of `lcg` and `Seed`
variables' size.

Moreover, the PRVHASH systems can be freely daisy-chained by feeding their
outputs to `Seed`/`lcg` inputs, adding some security firewalls, and increasing
the PRNG period of the final output accordingly. Note that any external PRNG
output can be inputted via either `Seed`, `lcg`, or both, yielding PRNG period
exponent summation. For hashing and external unstructured entropy, only
simultaneous input via `Seed` and `lcg` works in practice (period's exponent
increase occurs as well).

While `lcg`, `Seed`, and `Hash` variables are best initialized with good
entropy source (however, structurally, they can accept just about any entropy
quality while only requiring an initial "conditioning"), the message can be
sparsely-random: even an increasing counter can be considered as having a
suitable sparse entropy.

## Two-Bit PRNG ##

This is a "just for fun" example, but it passes 256 MB PractRand threshold.
You CAN generate pseudo-random numbers by using 2-bit shuffles; moreover, you
can input external entropy into the system.

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include "prvhash_core.h"
#define PH_HASH_COUNT 42

int main()
{
	uint8_t Seed = 0;
	uint8_t lcg = 0;
	uint8_t Hash[ PH_HASH_COUNT ] = { 0 };
	int HashPos = 0;
	int l;

	for( l = 0; l < 256; l++ )
	{
		uint8_t r = 0;
		int k;

		for( k = 0; k < 4; k++ )
		{
			r <<= 2;
			r |= prvhash_core2( &Seed, &lcg, Hash + HashPos );

			HashPos++;

			if( HashPos == PH_HASH_COUNT )
			{
				HashPos = 0;
			}
		}

		if( l > PH_HASH_COUNT / 3 ) // Skip PRNG initialization.
		{
			printf( "%4i ", (int) r );
		}
	}
}
```

## Streamed Hashing ##

The file `prvhash64s.h` includes a relatively fast streamed hashing function
by utilizing a "parallel" PRVHASH structure. Please take a look at the
`prvhash64s_oneshot()` function for usage example. The `prvhash64s` offers
an increased security and speed.

This function has an increased preimage resistance compared to the basic
hash function implementation. Preimage resistance cannot be currently
estimated exactly, but the hash length affects it exponentially. Also,
preimage attack usually boils down to exchange of forged symbols to "trash"
symbols (at any place of the data stream); substitutions usually end up as
being quite random, possibly damaging to any compressed or otherwise
structured file. Which means that data compression software and libraries
should always check any left-over, "unused", data beyond the valid compressed
stream, for security reasons.

Time complexity for preimage attack fluctuates greatly as preimage resistance
likely has a random-logarithmic PDF of timing.

Even though a formal proof is not yet available, the author assumes this
hash function can compete with widely-used SHA2 and SHA3 families of hash
functions while at the same time offering a considerably higher performance
and scalability. When working in open systems, supplying a secret seed is not
a requirement for this hash function.

The performance (expressed in cycles/byte) of this hash function on various
platforms can be evaluated at the
[ECRYPT/eBASH project](https://bench.cr.yp.to/results-hash.html).

The default `prvhash64s.h`-based 64-bit hash of the string `The cat is out of
the bag` is `2043ccf52ae2ca6f`.

The default `prvhash64s.h`-based 256-bit hash of the string
`Only a toilet bowl does not leak` is
`b13683799b840002689a1a42d93c826c25cc2d1f1bc1e48dcd005aa566a47ad8`.

The default `prvhash64s.h`-based 256-bit hash of the string
`Only a toilet bowl does not leaj` is
`d4534a922fd4f15ae8c6cc637006d1f33f655b06d60007a226d350e87e866250`.

This demonstrates the [Avalanche effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_effect).
On a set of 216553 English words, pair-wise hash comparisons give average
50.0% difference in resulting hash bits, which fully satisfies the strict
avalanche criterion.

This streamed hash function produces hash values that are different to the
`prvhash64` hash function. It is incorrect to use both of these hash function
implementations on the same data set. While `prvhash64` can be used as a hash
for hash-tables and in-memory data blocks, `prvhash64s` can be used to create
hashes of large data blocks like files, in streamed mode.

A proposed short name for hashes created with `prvhash64s.h` is `PRH64S-N`,
where `N` is the hash length in bits (e.g. `PRH64S-256`). Or simply, `SH4-N`,
`Secure Hash 4`.

## Description ##

Here is the author's vision on how the core hash function works. In actuality,
coming up with this solution was accompanied with a lot of trial and error.
It was especially hard to find a better "hashing finalization" solution.

	Seed ^= msgw; lcg ^= msgw; // Mix in external entropy (or daisy-chain).

	Seed *= lcg * 2 + 1; // Multiply random by random, without multiply by zero.
	const uint64_t rs = Seed >> 32 | Seed << 32; // Produce halves-swapped copy.
	Hash += rs + 0xAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA; // Accumulate to hash, add raw entropy (self-start).
	lcg += Seed + 0x5555555555555555; // Output-bound entropy accumulation, add raw entropy.
	Seed ^= Hash; // Mix new seed value with hash. Entropy feedback.
	const uint64_t out = lcg ^ rs; // Produce "compressed" output.

This function can be arbitrarily scaled to any even-sized variables: 2-, 4-,
8-, 16-, 32-, 64-bit variable sizes were tested, with similar statistical
results. Since mathematical structure of the function does not depend on the
variables' size, statistical analysis can be performed using smaller variable
sizes, with the results being extrapolatable to larger variable sizes, with a
high probability (the function is invariant to the variable size). Also note
that the `0xAAAA...` constant is not an arbitrary constant since it should be
produced algorithmically by replicating the `10` bit-pairs, to match the
variable size; it represents the "raw entropy bit-train". The same applies to
the `0x5555...` constant. An essential property of these bit-trains is that
they are uncorrelated to any uniformly-random bit-sequences, at all times.

It's important to point out that the presence of the `0xAAAA...` and
`0x5555...` constants logically assure that the `Seed` and `lcg` variables
quickly recover from the "zero-state". Beside that, these constants logically
prohibit synchronous control over `Seed` and `lcg` variables: different bits
of the input entropy will reach these variables. When the system starts from
the "zero-state", with many hashwords in the system, it is practically
impossible to find a preimage (including a repetitious one) that stalls the
system, and thus it is impossible to perform a multi-collision attack.
However, since this risk cannot be estimated exactly, the `prvhash64s` hash
function adds a message length value to the end of the data stream.

How does it work? First of all, this PRNG system, represented by the core hash
function, does not work with numbers in a common sense: it works with
[entropy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)),
or random sequences of bits. The current "expression" of system's overall
internal entropy - the `Seed` - gets multiplied ("smeared") by a supporting,
output-bound variable - `lcg`, - which is also a random value, transformed in
an LCG-alike manner. As a result, a new random value is produced which
represents two independent random variables (in lower and higher parts of the
register), a sort of "entropy stream sub-division" happens. This result is
then halves-swapped, and is accumulated in the `Hash` together with a `10`
bit-train which adds the "raw entropy", allowing the system to be
self-starting. The original multiplication result is accumulated in the `lcg`
variable. The `Seed` is then updated with the hashword produced on previous
rounds. The reason the message's entropy (which may be sparse or non-random)
does not destabilize the system is because the message becomes hidden in the
internal entropy (alike to a cryptographic one-time-pad); message's
distribution becomes unimportant. Both accumulations - of the halves-swapped
and the original version - produce a uniformly-distributed value in the
corresponding variables; a sort of "de-sub-division" happens.

The two instructions - `Seed *= lcg * 2 + 1`, `lcg += Seed` - represent an
"ideal" bit-shuffler: this construct represents a "bivariable shuffler" which
transforms the input `lcg` and `Seed` variables into another pair of variables
with 50% bit difference relative to input, and without collisions. The whole
core hash function, however, uses a more complex mixing which produces a hash
value: the pair composed of the hash value and either a new `lcg` or a new
`Seed` value also produces no input-to-output collisions. Thus it can be said
that the system does not lose any input entropy. In 4-dimensional analysis,
when `Seed`, `lcg`, `Hash`, and `msgw` values are scanned and transformed into
`lcg ^ rs` output, this system does exhibit local state change-related
collisions due to external entropy input, with a probability
1/4<sup>var_size_bits</sup>; this may not be enough for a reliable 8-bit
hashing, but for higher state variable sizes it becomes adequate since
system's overall collision resistance is a multiplication of such
probabilities across the hashword array; however, on very sparse entropy input
the multiplication of probabilities would occur only on few rounds. While
non-parallel hashing may even start from the "zero-state", for reliable
hashing the state after 5 "conditioning" rounds should be used.

Another important aspect of this system, especially from the cryptography
standpoint, is the entropy input to output latency. The base latency for
state-to-state transition is equal to 1 (2 for "parallel" arrangements); and
at the same time, 1 in hash-to-hash direction: this means that PRVHASH
additionally requires a full pass through the hashword array, for the entropy
to propagate, before using its output. However, hashing also requires a pass
to the end of the hashword array if message's length is shorter than the
output hash, to "mix in" the initial hash value. When there is only 1 hashword
in use, there is no hashword array-related delay, and thus the entropy
propagation is only subject to the base latency. The essence of these
"latencies" is that additional rounds are needed for the system to get rid of
statistical traces of the input entropy. Note that the "parallel"
structure/arrangement increases shuffling quality. However, this increase is
relative to the state variable size: for example, 8-bit parallel-2 arrangement
with 8-bit input is equivalent to 16-bit non-parallel arrangement with 16-bit
input. So, it is possible to perform hashing with 8-bit state variables if
parallel-2 round is done per 1 input byte.

Without external entropy (message) injections, the function can run for a
prolonged time, generating pseudo-entropy without much repetitions. When the
external entropy (message) is introduced, the function "shifts" into an
unrelated state unpredictably. So, it can be said that the function "jumps"
within a space of a huge number of pseudo-random sub-sequences. Hash
length affects the size of this "space of sub-sequences", permitting the
function to produce quality hashes for any required hash length.
Statistically, these "jumps" are close to uniformly-random repositioning: each
simultaneous augmentation of `Seed` and `lcg` corresponds to a new random
position, with a spread over the whole PRNG period. The actual performace is
more complicated as this PRNG system is able to converge into unrelated random
number sequences of varying lengths, so the "jump" changes both the position
and the "index" of sub-sequence. This property of PRVHASH assures that
different initial states of its `Seed` state variable (or `lcg`, which is
mostly equivalent at initialization stage) produce practically unrelated
random number sequences, permitting to use PRVHASH for PRNG-based simulations.

In essence, the hash function generates a continuous pseudo-random number
sequence, and returns the final part of the sequence as a result. The message
acts as a "pathway" to this final part. So, the random sequence of numbers can
be "programmed" to produce a necessary outcome. However, as this PRNG does
not expose its momentary internal state, such "programming" is hardly possible
to perform for an attacker, even if the entropy input channel is exposed:
consider an `(A^C)*(B^C)` equation; an adversary can control `C`, but does not
know the values of `A` and `B`, thus this adversary cannot predict the
outcome. Beside that, as the core hash function naturally eliminates the bias
from the external entropy of any statistical quality and frequency, its
control may be fruitless. Note that to reduce such "control risks", the
entropy input should use as fewer bits as possible, like demonstrated in
`prvrng.h`.

P.S. The reason the InitVec in the `prvhash64` hash function has the value
quality constraints and an initial non-zero state, is that otherwise the
function would require 5 preliminary "conditioning" rounds (core hash function
calls) to neutralize any oddities (including zero values) in InitVec; that
would reduce the performance of the hash function dramatically, for hash-table
uses. Note that the `prvhash64s` function starts from the "full zero" state
and then performs acceptably.

## Hashing Method's Philosophy ##

Any external entropy (message) that enters this PRNG system acts as a
high-frequency and high-quality re-seeding which changes the random number
generator's "position" within the PRNG period, randomly. In practice, this
means that two messages that are different in even 1 bit, at any place,
produce "final" random number sequences, and thus hashes, that are completely
unrelated to each other. This also means that any smaller part of the
resulting hash can be used as a complete hash. Since the hash length affects
the PRNG period (and thus the combinatorial capacity) of the system, the same
logic applies to hashes of any length while meeting collision resistance
specifications for all lengths.

Alternatively, the method can be viewed from the standpoint of classic
bit-mixers/shufflers: the hashword array can be seen as a "working buffer"
whose state is passed back into the "bivariable shuffler" continuously, and
the new shuffled values stored in this working buffer for the next pass.

## PRNG Period Assessment ##

The following "minimal" implementation for PractRand class can be used to
independently assess randomness period properties of PRVHASH. By varying
the `PH_HASH_COUNT` and `PH_PAR_COUNT` values it is possible to test various
PRNG system sizes. By adjusting other values it is possible to test PRVHASH
scalability across different state variable sizes (PractRand class and PRNG
output size should be matched, as PractRand test results depend on PRNG output
size). The PractRand should be run with the `-tlmin 64KB` parameter to
evaluate changes to the constants quicker. Note that both `PH_HASH_COUNT` and
`PH_PAR_COUNT` affect the PRNG period exponent not exactly linearly for small
variable sizes: there is a saturation factor present for small variable sizes;
after some point the period increase is non-linear due to small shuffling
space. Shuffling space can be increased considerably with a "parallel"
arrangement. Depending on the initial seed value, the period may fluctuate.
The commented out `Ctr++...` instructions can be uncommented to check the
period increase due to sparse entropy input. You may also notice the `^=h`
instructions: PRVHASH supports feedback onto itself (it's like hashing its own
output). This operation, which can be only applied to the last parallel
element, maximizes the achieved PRNG period.

## PRVHASH Cryptanalysis Basics ##

When the system state is not known, when PRVHASH acts as a black-box, one has
to consider core hash function's statistical properties. All internal
variables - `Seed`, `lcg`, and `Hash` - are random: they are uncorrelated to
each other at all times, and are also wholly-unequal during the PRNG period
(they are not just time-delayed versions of each other). Moreover, as can be
assured with PractRand, all of these variables can be used as random number
generators (with a lower period, though); they can even be interleaved after
each round.

When the message enters the system via `Seed ^= msgw` and `lcg ^= msgw`
instructions, it works like mixing a message with an one-time-pad used in
cryptography. This operation completely hides the message in system's entropy.
Beside that, the output of PRVHASH uses the mix of two variables:
statistically, this means the mixing of two unrelated random variables, with
such summary output never appearing in system's state. It is worth noting the
`lcg ^ rs` expression: the `rs` variable is composed of two halves, both of
them practically being independent PRNG outputs, with smaller periods. This
additionally complicates system's reversal.

## Fused PRNG ##

While this "fused-3" arrangement is currently not used in the hash function
implementations, it is also working fine with the core hash function.
For example, while the "minimal PRNG" described earlier has `0.90` cycles/byte
performance, the "fused" arrangement has a PRNG performance of `0.47`
cycles/byte, with a possibility of further scaling using AVX-512 instructions.
Note that hashword array size should not be a multiple of the number of
"fused" elements, otherwise PRNG stalls.

```

## PRVHASH16 ##

`prvhash16` demonstrates the quality of the core hash function. While the
state variables are 16-bit, they are enough to perform hashing: this hash
function passes all SMHasher tests, like the `prvhash64` function does, for
any hash length. This function is very slow, and is provided for demonstration
purposes only, to assure that the core hash function works in principle,
independent of state variable size. This hash function variant demonstrates
that PRVHASH's method does not rely on bit-shuffling alone (shuffles are
purely local), but is genuinely based on PRNG position "jumps".

## TANGO642 ##

This is an efficient implementation of a PRVHASH PRNG-based streamed XOR
function. Since no cryptanalysis nor certification of this function were
performed yet, it cannot be called a "cipher", but rather a cipher-alike
random number generator.

The performance (expressed in cycles/byte) of this function on various
platforms can be evaluated at the
[ECRYPT/eBASC project](https://bench.cr.yp.to/results-stream.html).

## Other Thoughts ##

PRVHASH, being scalable, potentially allows to apply "infinite" state variable
size in its system, at least in mathematical analysis. This reasoning makes
PRVHASH comparable to PI in its reach of "infinite" bit-sequence length.
Moreover, this also opens up a notion of "infinite frequency" and thus,
"infinite energy".

The mathematics offers an interesting understanding. Take in your mind a
moment before the Big Bang. Did mathematical rules exist at that moment? Of
course, they did, otherwise there would be no Big Bang. The span of existence
of mathematical rules cannot be estimated, so it is safe to assume they
existed for an eternity. On top of that, PRVHASH practically proves that
entropy can self-start from zero-, or "raw" state, or "nothing", if
mathematical rules exist prior to that.

I, as the author of PRVHASH, would like to point out at some long-standing
misconception in relating "combinatorics" to "random numbers". Historically,
cryptography was based on a concept of permutations, mixed with some sort of
mathematical operations: most hashes and ciphers use such "constructs".
However, when viewing a system as having some "combinatorial capacity" or
the number of bit combinations a given system may have, and combining this
understanding with "random permutations", it may give a false understanding
that "uniform randomness" may generate any combination within the limits of
"combinatorial capacity", with some probability. In fact, "uniform randomness"
auto-limits the "sparseness" of random bit-sequences it generates since
"too sparse" bit-sequence cannot be statistically called as uniformly-random.
Thus, "combinatorial capacity" of a system, when applied to random number
generation, transforms into a notion of ability of a system to generate
independent uniformly-random number sequences. Which means that two different
initial states of a PRNG system may refer to different "isolated" PRNG
sequences. This is what happens in PRVHASH: on entropy input the system may
"jump" or "converge" into an unrelated random sub-sequence.

`10` in binary is `2` in decimal, `1010` is `10`, `101010` is `42`...

The `sin(x)/x` (sinc function) series gives an idea why it all works: it is
squaring and integrating, ad infinitum.

During the course of PRVHASH development, the author has found that the
simplest low-frequency sine-wave oscillator can be used as a pseudo-random
number generator, if its mantissa is treated as an integer number. This means
that every point on a sinusoid has properties of a random bit-sequence.

```
#include <math.h>
#include <stdint.h>

class DummyRNG : public PractRand::RNGs::vRNG16 {
public:
double si;
double sincr;
double svalue1;
double svalue2;

DummyRNG() {
	si = 0.001;
	sincr = 2.0 * cos( si );
	seed( 0 );
}

Uint16 raw16() {
	uint64_t Value = ( *(uint64_t*) &svalue1 ) >> 4;

	const double tmp = svalue1;
	svalue1 = sincr * svalue1 - svalue2;
	svalue2 = tmp;

	return (Uint16) ( Value ^ Value >> 16 ^ Value >> 32 );
}
void walk_state(PractRand::StateWalkingObject *walker) {}
void seed(Uint64 sv) {
	const double ph = sv * 3.40612158008655459e-19; // Random seed to phase.

	svalue1 = sin( ph );
	svalue2 = sin( ph - si );
}
std::string get_name() const {return "SINEWAVE";}
};
```

Another finding is that the `lcg * 2 + 1` construct works as PRNG even if the
multiplier is a simple increasing counter variable, when the second multiplier
is a high-entropy number.

```
#include <stdint.h>

class DummyRNG : public PractRand::RNGs::vRNG8 {
public:
uint64_t Ctr1;
DummyRNG() {
	Ctr1 = 1;
}
uint8_t compress( const uint64_t v )
{
	uint8_t r = 0;
	for( int i = 0; i < 64; i++ )
	{
		r ^= (uint8_t) (( v >> i ) & 1 );
	}
	return( r );
}
Uint8 raw8() {
	uint8_t ov = 0;
	for( int l = 0; l < 8; l++ )
	{
		ov <<= 1;
		ov ^= compress( 0x243F6A8885A308D3 * Ctr1 );
		Ctr1 += 2;
	}
	return( ov );
}
void walk_state(PractRand::StateWalkingObject *walker) {}
void seed(Uint64 sv) {}
std::string get_name() const {return "LCG";}
};
```

## Thanks ##

The author would like to thank Reini Urban for [his SMHasher
fork](https://github.com/rurban/smhasher), Chris Doty-Humphrey for
[PractRand](http://pracrand.sourceforge.net/), and 
Peter Schmidt-Nielsen for [AutoSat](https://github.com/petersn/autosat).
Without these tools it would not be possible to create PRVHASH which stands
the state-of-the-art statistical tests.
